# Emacs Config

This is my emacs config tree, trying hard to absorb others'
configs, like purcell, redguardtoo, etc.


## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed into
~/.emacs.d/elpa
